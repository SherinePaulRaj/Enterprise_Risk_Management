## Introduction

SA Bank, a medium-sized financial institution, serves around 100,000 customers and employs 150 staff members. The bank's current security infrastructure is outdated, resulting in vulnerabilities and multiple incidents over the past year, such as website hacks, ransomware attacks, and service disruptions due to SQL injections and DDoS attacks. This project proposes a comprehensive security infrastructure redesign within a budget of $500,000 to mitigate these risks.

## Current Network Architecture

The existing setup includes:
- **External Web Portal**: Provides online banking services.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic efficiently.
- Additional network components ensuring basic operation but lacking robust security measures.

## Current State Analysis

Recent assessments have identified several weaknesses:
- Insufficient encryption protocols leading to potential data breaches.
- Lack of modern threat detection and prevention systems.
- Vulnerable to common attack vectors, including DDoS and SQL injections.

## Proposed Solution

A redesigned network architecture is proposed to enhance security, including:
- **Enhanced Encryption**: Adoption of TLS and other protocols to secure data transmission.
- **Firewalls & Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: To monitor and filter incoming and outgoing traffic.
- **Cloud-Based Solutions**: Leverage scalable, secure cloud services for data storage and management.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Ensure ongoing compliance and security integrity.

## Compliance

The proposed design adheres to industry-standard regulations, including:
- **PCI DSS**: Ensuring secure transactions for online banking.
- **GDPR & CCPA**: Protecting user privacy and data integrity.

## Alternatives

Exploration of other security approaches:
- **On-Premises Solutions**: Traditional hardware setups, though with potential cost and flexibility challenges.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combine on-premises and cloud infrastructure for balanced security and scalability.

## Cost Analysis

The proposed budget of $500,000 is allocated as follows:
- **Hardware Upgrades**: Firewalls, IDS systems, secure routers.
- **Software Licenses**: Encryption tools, monitoring software.
- **Training & Maintenance**: Ongoing education for staff and system upkeep.

## Summary

The project provides a strategic roadmap for SA Union Bank to bolster its security posture. By addressing existing vulnerabilities and implementing a robust, scalable solution, the bank can mitigate future risks and ensure the safety of customer data and operations.

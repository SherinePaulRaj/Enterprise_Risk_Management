        "SA Bank, a medium-sized financial institution, serves around 100k customers and employs 150 staff members. The bank's current security infrastructure is outdated, leading to vulnerabilities. Incidents over the past year include website hacks, ransomware attacks, and service disruptions due to SQL injections and DDoS attacks. This report proposes a redesigned security architecture to address these issues within a $500k budget.\n",

        "# **2. Current Network Architecture**\n",
        "\n",
        "The existing setup includes:\n",
        "- **External Web Portal**: Provides online banking services.\n",
        "- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic efficiently.\n",
        "- **Web Servers**: Hosts web applications.\n",
        "- **Host Firewall**: Controls traffic between external and internal networks.\n",
        "- **Internal Systems**: Linux and Windows systems for operational roles.\n",
        "- **Main Database Server**: Stores critical customer and transaction data.\n",
        "- **External Devices**: Used by customers and remote employees.\n",
        "\n",

        "# **3. Current State Analysis**\n",
        "## Current Assets\n",
        "\n",
        "The infrastructure consists of:\n",
        "- Internet-facing applications, network infrastructure, hosts, and servers.\n",
        "- Data assets including customer information, transaction data, and financial records.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Current Threat Landscape\n",
        "\n",
        "- Frequent cyberattacks on the online banking platform.\n",
        "- Malware and ransomware compromising Windows and Linux systems.\n",
        "- Vulnerabilities from outdated software and insecure coding practices.\n",
        "- Challenges due to the shift to remote work.\n",

        "# **4. Proposed Solution**\n",
        "\n",
        "The proposed architecture focuses on the following enhancements:\n",
        "1. **Monitoring and Response**: Implement SIEM for real-time threat detection.\n",
        "2. **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs)**: Advanced filtering and blocking features.\n",
        "3. **VPN Tunnels**: Encrypted communication for remote users.\n",
        "4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Extra protection for access control.\n",
        "5. **Network Segmentation**: Separate subnets to limit lateral movement.\n",
        "6. **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)**: Real-time endpoint monitoring.\n",
        "7. **Web & Application Security**: Regular updates and patch management.\n",
        "8. **Data Backup & Disaster Recovery**: Incremental backups for minimal data loss.\n",
        "9. **Compliance Standards**: Adherence to regulations like PCI-DSS, SOX, GLBA.\n",
        "10. **Cybersecurity Training**: Regular awareness programs for staff.\n",
